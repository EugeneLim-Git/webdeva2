			<h2>The Cesspit. My Cesspit.</h2>
			<p>I'm a big fan of games, mainly those on the computer.</p>
			<p>My favourite genres include action shooters, turn-based games, occasional strategy,
			and I sometimes play table-top games online,
			which I play with my friends. And have my own creative writing projects that I hope to publish in the future. You can go to the 'About Me' page to learn a bit more about it.</p>

			<h2>The Early Days.</h2>
			<p>Majority of my interest in them came during my childhood, where I was exposed to many classic video games on consoles,
			despite them being far before my time. Alongside exposure to online content featuring games, online communities about those games, meeting friends with similar interests,
			and family who were into video games, it helped to foster a love for the activity,
			with one of my earliest gaming memories being the amazing Team Fortress 2.
			Now, I play games nearly every day.</p>
			<p>Of course, now I'm studying how to make them.</p>

			<h2>The Powerhouse.</h2>
			<p>I also like building computers, a hobby that was introduced to me after getting my first proper computer capable of playing video games.</p>
			<p>I've been through a total of 4 different computers, with parts carried over. It's been quite a journey.
			I've built computers for multiple people, and even have my latest creation on the right!</p>
